# RBI Guide Bot: Innovate to Educate Project
# Overview
Welcome to the RBI Guide Bot project, a cutting-edge initiative designed to innovate and educate using the power of artificial intelligence. This project leverages React.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and the OpenAI API to create an interactive guide bot that provides valuable information while incorporating features such as light mode, dark mode, and support for various GPT model versions.

# Features
1. Light Mode and Dark Mode
The RBI Guide Bot offers users the flexibility to choose between light mode and dark mode, ensuring a comfortable and personalized viewing experience. Whether you prefer a light, easy-on-the-eyes interface or a sleek and modern dark mode, the choice is yours.

2. GPT Model Versions
Stay ahead of the curve with the latest advancements in natural language processing. The RBI Guide Bot supports multiple versions of the GPT model, allowing users to choose the model that best fits their needs. Whether you want the power of GPT-3.5 or the efficiency of a newer version, the guide bot has you covered.

3. OpenAI API Integration
Harness the capabilities of OpenAI's state-of-the-art language models to deliver dynamic and context-aware responses. The integration with the OpenAI API enables the guide bot to provide informative and engaging content, making it a valuable resource for users seeking knowledge and assistance.

# Tech Stack
React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React.js is the foundation for the RBI Guide Bot's interactive and responsive frontend.

Node.js: As a server-side runtime, Node.js powers the backend of the project, handling requests, managing data, and ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and OpenAI API.

TypeScript: TypeScript brings static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer productivity. Its use in this project contributes to a more robust and maintainable codebase.

OpenAI API: The OpenAI API is the driving force behind the intelligent responses generated by the guide bot. It allows the application to tap into the capabilities of advanced GPT models for natural language understanding.
